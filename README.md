## PERFORMER

Performer is set of tools to preform stress, load and performance. Main purpose is to simulate live traffic in telecommunication networks, preparing good blend of input data and corresponded scenarios. It is made to execute test scenario collect signalling, provisioning and system utilisation report. Scenarios are executed using Seagull tool for SIP, DIAMETER simulation or JMETER tool or HTTP/FTP/SOAP/REST interfaces.
Tool has distributive architecture and simulated traffic are unlimited  

## Tool set: 
- Blender: input data mixer
- Templer:  it is general tool to make from templet files scenarios in .xml,.jmx ... formats 
   - Seagull templer: make accordingly seagull configurations and scenarios
   - JMeter templer: make accordingly jmx scenarios
- Log & Alarms Collector: collection and parse logs file
- System Performances Monitoring: catch all system performance as cpu,mem,network,disk-io up 
- Reporter: make report .pdf
- Web Configuration and Execution Manager: web tool to perfrom operations
